              <p>I am a design-centric software engineer who likes to start with the big picture. 
              I believe UI/UX plays a crucial role when developing software and I enjoy working on products and teams who agree on its importance. 
              I am highly detailed oriented. I enjoy writing clean code, primarily following Robert Martinâ€™s school of thought. 
              I do not like taking shortcuts, especially when it comes to software development. I love to learn. 
              I write code because I like too.</p>
